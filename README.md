### Hi ðŸ‘‹! My name is Anurag Prasad
<hr>
<!--p>ðŸŒ±Currently, I am enthusiastically pursuing a <b>Post-Graduate Diploma in Statistical Methods and Analytics (PGDSMA) at the esteemed Indian Statistical Institute, North-East Centre (Tezpur) (ISI, NEC)</b>. My deep interest in <b>Data Science</b> has led me to embark on this journey, where I am immersing myself in the intricacies of <b>statistical analysis, data visualization, Machine Learning/AI, and predictive modeling</b>.
Having successfully completed my graduation in <b>Computer Science and Engineering (CSE)</b>, I developed a strong foundation in programming, algorithms, and problem-solving. Further enhancing my skill set, I also attained a PGDM in Development Management, which provided me with a holistic understanding of managing projects and teams effectively.
</p-->
<p>
With 2+ years of hands-on experience in the data domain, Iâ€™ve worked across diverse industries, addressing complex business challenges and delivering impact-oriented, data-driven solutions to enhance decision-making processes.
  
Currently, I am working remotely as a Consultant (Quantitative Researcher) for a US-based Quant Finance startup, co-founded by industry veterans with 80+ patents, 1500+ citations, and leadership backgrounds at Microsoft, Skyflow, Fujitsu, Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank, and Goldman Sachs. The firm is pioneering cutting-edge solutions at the intersection of AI and Quantitative Finance, focusing on systematic trading strategies and scalable AI infrastructure.

Previously, I completed a paid Data Analyst internship at a startup BVPL, Gurugram, where I was assigned to a live client project from day one. Despite a steep learning curve, our small team overcame challenges and delivered all milestones ahead of schedule, avoiding any project penalties from the client. My contributions towards building scalable data pipelines, conducting rigorous Data Quality validations (manual and automated) testcases, and ensuring high-precision Data delivery along with the development of robust web crawlers/scrapers for over 200+ data schemas/fields, mainly focusing on (Product Description Pages (PDPs), reviews, and search crawlers). In addition, I contributed to designing data acquisition infrastructure for public domain scraping, serving a major Israeli client, Bright Data â€” a leader in web data solutions.

I have also earned a Post-Graduate Diploma in Statistical Methods and Analytics (PGDSMA) from the prestigious Indian Statistical Institute, North-East Centre (Tezpur) - a highly selective program with an acceptance rate of less than 2% . A rigorous program that deepened my expertise in Foundational Mathematical concepts, advanced statistical modeling, data visualization, machine learning, and AI-driven predictive analytical methods.

My academic foundation lies in a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE)â€”admission earned through a competitive entrance examinationâ€”which equipped me with a solid grounding in software development, algorithms, and computational problem-solving. To broaden my managerial and organizational perspective, I also pursued a Post-Graduate Diploma in Development Management (PGDM)â€”a rigorous program requiring 100% attendanceâ€”which strengthened my skills in project management, strategic execution, and team leadership.
